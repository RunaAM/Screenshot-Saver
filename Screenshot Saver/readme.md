# Screenshot Saver

#### Tool used for saving screenshots and photos from clipboard to files

# Why?

Because I hate how screenshots in Windows 10 arent automatically saved
and I have to use paint to save or paste it where i want to send immediatly. 
Plus the amount of times i lost pictures in clipboard drove me insane so I created this.


# How to use?

When you open the app, select directory and the name of the file to save (when you save multiple photos copies will be created with the same name just like windows does)
To save a picture either press the button or use the shortcut Win + Alt + S.
You can hide/show the app window by pressing the system tray icon.
